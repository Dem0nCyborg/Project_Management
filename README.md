`# Project Management App

Welcome to our project management app, developed during the HackHaven hackathon! üöÄ

## Overview

Our app is designed to streamline project management processes by providing a collaborative platform for teams. It allows users to create and join projects, upload and retrieve documents securely using Firebase cloud storage, conduct video conferences using the Zego Cloud API, and manage tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Project Creation and Joining**: Users can create new projects or join existing ones.
- **Document Management**: Upload and retrieve documents related to the project, ensuring seamless collaboration.
- **Video Conferencing**: Conduct video conferences within the app using the Zego Cloud API for effective communication.
- **Task Management**: Keep track of tasks by adding, assigning, and monitoring their progress.
